# Regression test for dependency-tree exclusion in validate-structure.sh (issue #84).
#
# The CLAUDE.md-symlink scan excludes vendor/ and node_modules/, but the scoped
# AGENTS.md scan did not — so third-party AGENTS.md files shipped inside an
# installed composer vendor/ tree were validated as if they were the project's
# own, reporting their missing sections as project errors. TYPO3 extensions
# install dependencies under .Build/vendor/, so that path must be excluded too.
