# Test for the generate-agents.sh write manifest (issue #107).
#
# generate-agents.sh is the only script in the skill that writes, and was the
# only one without --json. The manifest lists one entry per path the run
# touches, so a caller can review exactly what would change (--dry-run) or what
# did change (without it) instead of parsing nine different prose lines.
