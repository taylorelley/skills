# Regression test for dependency-tree exclusion in verify-content.sh and
# check-freshness.sh.
#
# Both scripts inspected every AGENTS.md below the project root, including
# third-party ones shipped in vendor/, node_modules/ and a TYPO3 extension's
# .Build/. verify-content.sh then reported those packages' own file references
# as "File documented in ... does not exist" errors against the project (12
# errors on a TYPO3 extension once `composer install` had run), and
# check-freshness.sh rated their freshness. validate-structure.sh already
# excludes the same trees (#84).
