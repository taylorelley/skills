# Regression test: a directory that already carries an AGENTS.md must appear in
# the root scope index, even when detect-scopes.sh has no rule for that
# directory name.
#
# The bug: the index was built purely from detected scopes. detect-scopes.sh
# knows a fixed set of directory names, so a hand-authored scoped file
# elsewhere (TYPO3 `Configuration/`, for one) was silently dropped from the
# root index on `--update`. An agent reading the root then never learns the
# file exists, which defeats the precedence rule the index exists to serve —
# and nothing reports the omission.
