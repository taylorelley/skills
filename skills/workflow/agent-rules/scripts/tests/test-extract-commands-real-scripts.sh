# project actually defines, never the first name it happened to look for.
#
# The bug: the PHP branch accepted `.scripts.format // .scripts["cs:fix"]` as
# evidence and then printed `composer run format` unconditionally. A project
# defining only `cs:fix` therefore had `composer run format` written into its
# AGENTS.md — a command that does not exist, presented to agents as fact.
# The same shape applied to `lint` (via `cs:check`) and `phpstan` (via `stan`).
