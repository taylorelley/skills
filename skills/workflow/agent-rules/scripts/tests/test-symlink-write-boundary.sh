# Regression test for the CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md write boundary (issues #102, #103).
#
# Two defects, both in generate-agents.sh:
#   #102  --no-symlinks was documented in --help but dropped by the parser, so
#         the symlinks were created regardless of the flag.
#   #103  an existing CLAUDE.md that is itself a symlink was treated like a
#         missing file and repointed to AGENTS.md — no --force, no message —
#         because the guard tested "[ -L ] || [ ! -e ]".
